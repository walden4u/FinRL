## Docker Build Log for FinRL Project

**Target Build Command:**
```bash
docker build -t finrl-lab -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

**Previous Build Issues & Resolutions:**

1.  **Issue:** `pygame` build failed due to missing `longintrepr.h` (Python 3.12 incompatibility with older pygame).
    *   **Resolution:** Added `pygame>=2.5.2` explicitly to `requirements.txt`.

2.  **Issue:** `gym` metadata generation failed (dependency conflict, likely due to older `gym` version pulled by other packages) - **Persisted after previous resolution attempts.**
    *   **Resolution Attempt 1:**
        *   Removed `gymnasium` from `requirements.txt`.
        *   Changed `stable-baselines3` to `stable-baselines3[extra]` in `requirements.txt`.
        *   Removed `-I` flag from `pip install` in `docker/Dockerfile`.
    *   **Resolution Attempt 2 (Current):** Commented out `elegantrl` in `requirements.txt` (suspected source of `gym` dependency issue).

**Result:**
Build **SUCCESSFUL** after commenting out `elegantrl`.

**Next Step:**
Run the Docker container using the built image.
